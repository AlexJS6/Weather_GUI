## My Project
This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) made with tkinter to learn even more about the possibilities of python.   
Many videos say that making a GUI is very good for a beginner in python.  
So I did it and it is very interesting and pretty fun to do!  
I did a weather GUI that shows the name of the country chosen, description of the weather and temperature with the help of an api: 'openweathermap.org'.   
I will actually use it often to see the temperature outside :)   
This was once more a very short but interesting project to learn more about my new love for python.
